# GptKnowledgeHelper

This repository contains two Node.js scripts designed to provide a clear visualization of a project's directory structure. `ProjectJSON.js` creates a JSON representation of the directory, and `ProjectMarkdown.js` generates a markdown document.
I initially made it to help with my react project, so you may need to modify it based your file structure.
